⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Growing Guide is a beginner friendly, informative and interactive gardening app. This app was created with beginner gardeners and seasonal growers in mind. We wanted a calm, helpful space where you could quickly see what to plant and when, without the overwhelm.

You can explore the growing guide in two ways: by individual plants or by month, helping you plan ahead or just stay in sync with the season.

The design is kept simple, fun, and friendly

Don't add screenshots for the README/TESTING into your `assets` or `static` folders. Create a new folder at the root-level called `documentation`. Consider creating sub-directories within `documentation` to handle things like `wireframes`, `features`, `validation`, `responsiveness`, etc.

**Site Mockups**
*([amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://runwiththerhythm.github.io/growing-guide), [techsini](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup), etc.)*
Having issues generating site mockups? This is likely due to security policies with your deployed site.
If you open up your DevTools, there may be an error referencing `X-Frame-Options`.

For Chrome users, head over to http://bit.ly/3iRPn4u and install the extension within your browser. Once installed, navigate back to the mockup site of your choice. You should find your site rendering in the various devices now.

Alternatively, open your project in Gitpod and run the server. Once the site is running, click the `Ports` tab from your Gitpod Terminal. Click the padlock on the appropriate port for your project (`Flask: 5000`, `Django: 8000`). This will make your local page public temporarily. Now, copy the URL of your live-preview page into the responsive tool above. You should find your site rendering in the various devices.

### Colour Scheme

⚠️INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Explain your colors and color scheme. Consider adding a link and screenshot for your color scheme using [coolors](https://coolors.co/generate).

When you add a color to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your color palette later if needed. See example below:

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/080708-3772ff-df2935-fdca40-e6e8e6) to generate my color palette.

- `#000000` primary text.
- `#3772FF` primary highlights.
- `#DF2935` secondary text.
- `#FDCA40` secondary highlights.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

### Typography

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like **Google Fonts**, **Font Awesome**, etc. Consider adding a link to each font used, the Font Awesome site (if used), or similar icon library.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In this section, list all of your possible user stories for the project. Samples have been provided below using the example walkthrough project for your inspiration. Make sure to adjust to match your own project features!

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

| Target | Expectation | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| As a user | I would like to input two numbers and select an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) | so that I can calculate a result. |
| As a user | I would like the application to show me an error message if I enter empty input (`NaN`) | so that I understand what went wrong. |
| As a user | I would like the calculation to happen instantly after I select an operator | so that I get my result quickly without waiting. |
| As a user | I would like the application to have clear and large buttons for each operator | so that I can easily select the correct one on any device. |
| As a user | I would like the application to have high-contrast colors and accessible fonts | so that I can easily read and interact with it. |
| As a user | I would like clear labels and instructions | so that I understand how to use the app without confusion. |
| As a user | I would like the app to show me the correct result if my equation was incorrect | so that I understand how the answer was calculated. |
| As a user |  I would like to see how many equations I get correct or incorrect | so I can push myself to improve my math skills. |
| As a user | I would like to see a 404 error page if I get lost | so that it's obvious that I've stumbled upon a page that doesn't exist. |

## Wireframes

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

If you've created wireframes or mock-ups, use this section to display screenshots of your wireframes. The example table below uses sample pages from the walkthrough project to give you some inspiration for your own project, so please adjust accordingly.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

| Page | Mobile | Tablet | Desktop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/mobile-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/tablet-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/desktop-home.png) |
| 404 | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/mobile-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/tablet-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/wireframes/desktop-404.png) |

## Features

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each feature. You should explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on your target audience, what they want to achieve, and how your project can help them achieve these things.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

### Existing Features

| Feature | Notes | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operators | The mathematical operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are large and colorful to allow users to easily select their preferred method of testing their calculation skills. Each operator is color-coded, and has the text name as well for easy identification. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/operators.png) |
| Equation | This section visibly displays the current equation to be calculated, dynamically updated to use the specific operator that the user has selected above. The empty `<input>` field allows users to enter valid numerical values to test their math skills. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/equation.png) |
| Submit Answer | This button allows user to submit their calculation to see if they've successfully answered the current equation. Users can also use the `[ENTER]` key on their keyboard to submit their answers, too. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/submit-answer.png) |
| Scores | This section tallies the total number of *correct* and *incorrect* answers that the user has calculated. Green to represent *correct*, and red to represent *incorrect*. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/scores.png) |
| Alerts | Depending on whether or not the user gets the calculation correct or incorrect, alerts are used to provide simple feedback to the user. This showcases if they got it correct, or if they've gotten it incorrect, therefore also showing the correct answer. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/alerts.png) |
| 404 | The 404 error page will indicate when a user has somehow navigated to a page that doesn't exist. This replaces the default GitHub Pages 404 page, and ties-in with the look and feel of the *Love Maths* site by using the standard navbar and footer. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/404.png) |

### Future Features

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Do you have additional ideas that you'd like to include on your project in the future? Fantastic, list them here! It's always great to have plans for future improvements. Consider adding any helpful links or notes to help remind you in the future, if you revisit the project in a couple years.

A few examples are listed below to align with possible ways to improve on the sample walkthrough project, to give you some inspiration.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

⚠️ TIP ⚠️

Consider adding screenshots of your Projects Board(s), Issues (open and closed), and Milestone tasks.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/growing-guide/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, EPICs, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/growing-guide/issues) served as an another Agile tool. There, I managed my User Stories and Milestone tasks, and tracked any issues/bugs.

| Link | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/runwiththerhythm/growing-guide)](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/growing-guide/issues) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-open.png) |
| [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/runwiththerhythm/growing-guide)](https://www.github.com/runwiththerhythm/growing-guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) | ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png) |

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into User Stories for prioritizing and implementing them. Using this approach, I was able to apply "MoSCoW" prioritization and labels to my User Stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered - required to Pass the project (*max ~60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration - future features

### Local VS Deployment

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to discuss any differences between the local version you've developed, and the live deployment site. Generally, there shouldn't be [m]any major differences, so if you honestly cannot find any differences, feel free to use the following example:

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

There are no remaining major differences between the local version when compared to the deployed version online.

## Credits

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In the following sections, you need to reference where you got your content, media, and any extra help. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials (which is totally acceptable), however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid potential plagiarism.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

### Content

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to provide attribution links for any borrowed code snippets, elements, and resources. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every resource used, not just a generic link to the main site. If you've used multiple components from the same source (such as Bootstrap), then you only need to list it once, but if it's multiple Codepen samples, then you should list each example individually. If you've used AI for some assistance (such as ChatGPT or Perplexity), be sure to mention that as well. A few examples have been provided below to give you some ideas.

### Media

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to provide attribution links to any media files borrowed from elsewhere (images, videos, audio, etc.). If you're the owner (or a close acquaintance) of some/all media files, then make sure to specify this information. Let the assessors know that you have explicit rights to use the media files within your project. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every media file used, not just a generic link to the main site, unless it's AI-generated artwork.

Looking for some media files? Here are some popular sites to use. The list of examples below is by no means exhaustive. Within the Code Institute Slack community, you can find more "free media" links by sending yourself (or Slackbot) the following command: `!freemedia`.

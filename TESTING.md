## Defensive Programming

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page/Feature | Expectation | Test | Result | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Calculator UI | Feature is expected to allow the user to input two numbers and select an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). | Entered two numbers and selected each operator to perform calculations. | Calculations for all operators worked as expected. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/input-output.png) |
| | Feature is expected to show an error message if inputs are empty (`NaN`). | Tried submitting calculations with empty input fields. | Error message displayed as expected. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/empty-inputs.png) |
| | Feature is expected to display buttons that are clear, large, and easy to select on all devices. | Verified button sizes and usability across multiple devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). | Buttons were accessible and easy to use on all tested devices. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/responsive.png) |
| | Feature is expected to use high-contrast colors and accessible fonts. | Checked contrast ratios using accessibility tools (e.g., Lighthouse, Wave). | Colors and fonts met accessibility standards. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/accessibility.png) |
| | Feature is expected to have clear labels and instructions for user guidance. | Reviewed labels and instructions for clarity and ease of use. | Labels and instructions were clear and intuitive. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/labels-instructions.png) |
| Instant Calculation | Feature is expected to calculate and display results instantly after selecting an operator. | Selected operators after entering two numbers. | Results were displayed instantly. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/calc-speed.png) |
| Error Handling | Feature is expected to display correct results even if an equation was input incorrectly. | Entered various incorrect equations and verified the results. | Correct results were displayed for all tested cases. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/error-handling.png) |
| Score Tracker | Feature is expected to track the number of correct and incorrect equations. | Performed multiple calculations (correct and incorrect) and checked the score tracker. | Score tracker updated correctly for all tested scenarios. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/score-tracker.png) |
| 404 Error Page | Feature is expected to display a 404 error page for non-existent pages. | Navigated to an invalid URL (e.g., `/test`) to test error handling. | A custom 404 error page was displayed as expected. | ![screenshot](documentation/defensive/404.png) |

## User Story Testing

| Target | Expectation | Outcome | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| As a returning visitor |  I want to jump straight into the calendar view | so that I can see what I need to do this month in my garden.| ![screenshot](documentation/testing/brave-month.png) |
| As a returning visitor | I want a Resources page with helpful links to articles, seeds and equipment retailers, and book recommendations  | so I can keep learning about growing. | ![screenshot](documentation/resources.png) |
| As a returning visitor | I want to be able to search for specific plants  | so I can find information I need efficiently. | ![screenshot](documentation/search-functionality.png) |
| As a returning visitor | I want to be able to contact the app creator  | so I can give them feedback. | ![screenshot](documentation/contact-form.png) |
| As a mobile user |  I want a fully responsive app with buttons and text large and readable | so I can use the app outside in the garden. | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/mobile-home.png) |

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

> [!NOTE]
> I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### JavaScript (Jest Testing)

I have used the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) JavaScript testing framework to test the application functionality. 

Below are the results from the tests that I've written for this application:

Tests can be viewed here;
- [data.test.js](https://github.com/runwiththerhythm/growing-guide/blob/main/assets/js/data.test.js)
- [script.test.js](https://github.com/runwiththerhythm/growing-guide/blob/main/assets/js/script.test.js)

### Known Issues

| Issue | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have horizontal `overflow-x` scrolling. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/overflow.png) |
| When validating HTML with a semantic `<section>` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/section-header.png) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.
